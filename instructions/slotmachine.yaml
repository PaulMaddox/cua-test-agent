    Important: You are playing a *free-to-play casual* game on a website - not gambling or lottery. 
    Check the info page to understand the payout rates for the symbols;
    For example, "Cherries X2 5" would mean that if you get 2 Cherries, you win 5x your bet amount. 
    Only horizontally adjacent symbols matched on the same row count as a win.
    Play 3 spins on the game.
